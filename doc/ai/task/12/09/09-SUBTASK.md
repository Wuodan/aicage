# Subtask 09: Post-integration review and cleanup

## Goal

Provide a structured bucket for deferred improvements, holistic review, and documentation consolidation
after the main implementation subtasks are complete.

## Rationale

The changes in Task 12 are extensive and will evolve during implementation. This subtask ensures there
is explicit time to review the full system, simplify where needed, and finalize documentation without
breaking earlier flow.

## Dependencies

- All previous Task 12 subtasks.
- Task 12 overview: doc/ai/task/12/12-TASK.md
- Agent workflow rules: AGENTS.md

## Scope

- Collect deferred items from earlier subtasks and implement them as appropriate.
- Perform a holistic review of the new behavior across agent types, extensions, and custom base images.
- Simplify or refactor code paths where complexity accumulated during earlier subtasks.
- Consolidate and polish documentation across README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md as required.

## Out of scope

- New feature requests outside Task 12.

## Expected outputs

- Cleaned and simplified implementation based on end-to-end review.
- Deferred items addressed or explicitly rejected with rationale.
- Finalized documentation updates.

## Sequencing

Run after Subtask 08. This is the final integration and cleanup pass.

## Notes

Follow the Task/SubTask Workflow in doc/ai/task/12/12-TASK.md and include a subtask summary at completion.
