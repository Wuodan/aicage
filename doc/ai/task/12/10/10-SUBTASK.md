# Subtask 10: Documentation work-over

## Goal

Perform a comprehensive documentation review and update after all Task 12 functionality is complete.

## Rationale

Documentation changes will span multiple areas and should be consolidated after implementation to
ensure accuracy and consistency. A dedicated subtask provides a bucket to capture documentation
ideas throughout the work and apply them in one focused pass.

## Dependencies

- Subtask 09.
- Task 12 overview: doc/ai/task/12/12-TASK.md
- Agent workflow rules: AGENTS.md

## Scope

- Collect and track documentation notes from earlier subtasks in this subtask folder.
- Update end-user documentation as needed (README.md and any new user-facing docs).
- Update developer documentation as needed (DEVELOPMENT.md and internal docs).
- Ensure extension and custom image documentation is complete and consistent.

## Out of scope

- Functional changes to runtime behavior.
- New feature requests outside Task 12.

## Expected outputs

- Documentation aligned with implemented behavior across agents, extensions, and custom images.
- A reviewed and curated set of documentation changes based on accumulated notes.

## Sequencing

Run after Subtask 09 as the final Task 12 step.

## Notes

Follow the Task/SubTask Workflow in doc/ai/task/12/12-TASK.md and include a subtask summary at completion.
